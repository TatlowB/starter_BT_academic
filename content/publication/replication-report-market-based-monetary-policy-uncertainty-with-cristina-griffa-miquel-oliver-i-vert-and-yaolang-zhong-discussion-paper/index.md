abstract: This report replicates and examines Bauer et al.'s (2021) paper on
  monetary policy transmission to financial markets. The paper introduces novel
  measures of monetary policy uncertainty and analyses its drivers. It also
  investigates the impact of uncertainty changes on interest rates and financial
  asset prices. We assess reproducibility, consolidate market uncertainty
  measures using PCA and Factor Analysis, and rigorously test the reduction of
  uncertainty after Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) announcements. Our
  findings support the paper's claim of reduced uncertainty on meeting days.
  Additionally, we explore the implications of the uncertainty channel on
  various financial assets, such as Gold, the Swiss Franc, European stock
  indexes, and Bitcoin.
