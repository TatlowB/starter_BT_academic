I am a PhD Graduate of the [University of Nottingham School of Economics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nottingham.ac.uk%2Feconomics%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHTauq0gxeDcjP1drYCxVNEfMsyLQ), where I am currently working as a Teaching Associate.

I am Interested in and Looking for Analyst Roles located in Norway.

My current research focus is on the application of econometric tests in order to examine linkages between assets experiencing explosive behaviour. My main areas of interest are time series econometrics, asset price bubble detection and monitoring, usages of High Frequency and 'Big' data, and interconnectedness and contagion within assets.
